                My interest in carefully crafting experiences for others started with my love of music. Creating music with my peers has shown me time and time again how the power of collaboration can lead a group of people to create amazing new things that they would never have come up with by themselves. When all cylinders were firing, after all the work and time we spent practicing, the final product always felt indescribably fulfilling, especially when others could find joy in it. In the last few years, Iâ€™ve come to realize that same sense of collaborative achievement and wondrous creation is similarly present in UX work, and is even more impactful towards everyday interactions than I ever imagined.
